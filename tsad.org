  - underclock system it's too hot!

* Research
** [[Illya Sutskever phd][RNN]] have promise for ts b/c memory
** [[http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnrbm.html#rnnrbm][RNN-RBM]] Hessian free opt?
** rnn or cRBM 								  :Q:
** what input causes the hidden unit i to be maximally active?
   \[ a_i = f\left(\sum\limits_j \omega_{ij}^{(1)}x_j + b_j \right)    \]
   constraint $||x||_2=1||$
   \[ x_j = \frac{ \omega_{ij}^{(1)} }
                 { \sqrt{\sum\limits_j\left(\omega_{ij}^{(1)}\right)^2} } \]

* Experiment
  - nhidden
  - types of ts: frequency-rich, stnarity
*** data sources
    - sleep stage classification
    - astro
 
* pyleanr2
  - smaller data was faster on cpu. gpu shuffling?
  - the yaml thing makes it complicated for a beginner. it's supposed
    to make your life easier but it's another thing to learn it's weird

* Algorithm:
  - need to have invariance wrt time

* thesis
- thanks ted dunning, kirk borne, jay kaufold
* Illya Sutskever phd
